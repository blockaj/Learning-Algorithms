#Learning Algorithms
With the syntax and basic concepts of computer programming more 
or less under my belt, it's about time I start to learn about
how to apply those skills in the form of algorithms. I'll share my work
which will include Python scripts to start and hopefully some of those same
programs in C++ as I'd like to get a better handle on one of the most 
powerful, widely used programming languages in the world. 

##Getting started
I've been getting started with the basic insertion sort algorithm.
I'm currently learning about some of the concepts involved with the 
analysis and design of algorithms.
